This game illustrates how important it is to remove trash from our neighborhood and other nearby locations. It makes people realize how simple it is to keep our surroundings free of trash and protect us from major crises like land pollution. It simulates 1 human character and 1 trash object(Banana Peel) and as many times the human collects it the object relocates its self and each time you do so you earn 10 points.

Please download the main folder with the images folder and the main code.
You will have to download Pygame Zero with the command pip install pgzrero in your command prompt. 
Once you do so, be sure not to rename any files and run the code with any application, such as VsCode or Python Idle. 

Thankyou
